**Research objectives :**

-   A multiple regression model was constructed to predict body fat percentage in adult men.

-   Compare the difference between the model predictions and the results calculated by the formula provided by Siri (1956).

-   Explore which features have a significant impact on body fat percentage prediction.

**Body density calculation formula:**

the body consists of two components - lean body tissue and fat tissue. Letting:

-   D = Body Density (gm/cm\^3)

-   A = proportion of lean body tissue

-   B = proportion of fat tissue

-   A + B = 1

-   a = density of lean body tissue (gm/cm\^3) = 1.10 gm/cm\^3

-   b = density of fat tissue (gm/cm\^3) = 0.90 gm/cm\^3

-   D = 1/\[(A/a) + (B/b)\]

The above equation shows that the body density calculation formula of human body is:

D = 1/{B/\[ab/(a-b)\] - \[b/(a-b)\]}

[**Siri Equation**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B978148323110550011X?via%3Dihub) **:**

BodyFat%=(Density/495)−450

By combining these two formulas, we can accurately get the body fat percentage of the human body.

However, in daily life, we cannot easily know the proportion of fat tissue of an individual. Therefore, I try to predict the body fat percentage of an individual through the body's physical index data, such as (weight, height, waist circumference and other easily measurable indicators).

1.  Construct a multiple regression model to predict the body fat percentage of adult men and conduct predictive analysis.

```{r}

# The data is divided into training set and test set
set.seed(123)
train_index <- createDataPartition(body_fat_data$BodyFat, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_data <- body_fat_data[train_index, ]
test_data <- body_fat_data[-train_index, ]

# Build a multiple linear regression model
model <- lm(BodyFat ~ Age + Weight + Height + Neck + Chest + Abdomen + Hip + Thigh + Knee + Ankle + Biceps + Forearm + Wrist, 
            data = train_data)

# Show Model Summary
summary(model)

# Make predictions on the test set
test_data$Predicted_BodyFat <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)

# Show some prediction results
head(test_data)

```

```{r}

# Scatter plot for Actual vs Predicted
ggplot(test_data, aes(x = BodyFat, y = Predicted_BodyFat)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Actual vs Predicted Body Fat",
       x = "Actual Body Fat (%)",
       y = "Predicted Body Fat (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Calculate MSE and MAE
mse <- mean((test_data$BodyFat - test_data$Predicted_BodyFat)^2)
mae <- mean(abs(test_data$BodyFat - test_data$Predicted_BodyFat))

# Print error metrics
cat("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse, "\n")
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae, "\n")

# Reshape data for box plot
comparison <- test_data %>%
  select(BodyFat, Predicted_BodyFat) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(BodyFat, Predicted_BodyFat),
               names_to = "Method",
               values_to = "BodyFat")

# Box plot comparison
ggplot(comparison, aes(x = Method, y = BodyFat, fill = Method)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Actual and Predicted Body Fat",
       x = "Method",
       y = "Body Fat (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

**The data or visual analysis reports show that there are differences in the predictions.**

Thinking: Not all body indicators in the data set are related to body fat percentage. Calculate the impact of body indicators on body fat percentage.

```{r}

# Calculate the impact of important characteristics on body fat percentage
importance <- varImp(model, scale = FALSE)

# Display feature importance
importance %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("Feature") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Feature, Overall), y = Overall)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Feature Importance", 
       x = "Feature", 
       y = "Importance score") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Abdomen, chest, neck, forearm, hip and biceps are the most influential in predicting body fat percentage.

Use these 6 body indicators to build a multiple linear regression model

```{r}
# Extract the top six features with the highest importance scores
top_features <- c("Abdomen", "Wrist", "Neck", "Forearm", "Hip", "Biceps")

# Build a new model
new_model <- lm(BodyFat ~ Abdomen + Wrist + Neck + Forearm + Hip + Biceps, data = train_data)

# Show new model summary
summary(new_model)

# Make predictions on the test set
test_data$Predicted_BodyFat_New <- predict(new_model, newdata = test_data)



```

```{r}
# Scatter plot: actual values ​​vs new predicted values
ggplot(test_data, aes(x = BodyFat, y = Predicted_BodyFat_New)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Actual value vs new predicted value (first six feature model",
       x = "Actual Body Fat (%)",
       y = "Predicted Body Fat (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Box plot: Comparison of actual value and new predicted value distribution
comparison_new <- test_data %>%
  select(BodyFat, Predicted_BodyFat_New) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(BodyFat, Predicted_BodyFat_New),
               names_to = "Method",
               values_to = "BodyFat")

ggplot(comparison_new, aes(x = Method, y = BodyFat, fill = Method)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Actual and Predicted Body Fat",
       x = "method",
       y = "Body fat (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Calculation error index
mse_new <- mean((test_data$BodyFat - test_data$Predicted_BodyFat_New)^2)
mae_new <- mean(abs(test_data$BodyFat - test_data$Predicted_BodyFat_New))

# Printing error index
cat("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse_new, "\n")
cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae_new, "\n")
```

**Conclusion:**

Compare the MSE and MAE of the two comparative analyses. The second prediction has a higher error. Therefore, the conclusion is that the second analysis method failed. More analysis directions are needed in the future to determine how to accurately analyze body fat percentage with the same body indicators.
